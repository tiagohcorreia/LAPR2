# US 018 - Analyse the deals made, based on the characteristics of the property using simple liner regression and multilinear regression

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a store manager, I intend to analyse the deals (only sale of houses and
apartments) made. In particular, I intend to compare property sale values with the
forecast values. The prediction of the value of the business/property must be
estimated based on the characteristics of the property and using linear and
multilinear regression algorithms.

**From the client clarifications:**

>Question: A report containing regression methods, confidence intervals, and other US-related aspects of MATCP is mentioned in the Sprint D requirements document for US018. The team is wondering if this "report" refers to information that should be displayed in the application itself, the user manual, or both. And if the "report" isn't going to be displayed in the app, are we only going to show the user the forecasted price in relation to the chosen property and the regression model with all the necessary statistics?

>Answer: In US18 the application should show, to the store manager, the forecasts, the regression model, statistics, etc.. The teams should use this output of the application to write the report (annexes of the user manual).

>Question: When the store manager selects simple-linear regression to analyse the deals, does he also select one of the specified relevant parameters to serve as the [in]dependent variable in the regression model? ("property area in square feet, the distance from the center, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathroomsand the number of parking spaces").

>Answer: The store manager should choose the independent variable and the regression model to be used to fit the data.

>Question: When the store manager analyses the property values, can he analyse one property, all the properties, or a selection of properties of their choosing?

>Answer: The system should present the price estimates (using the selected regression model) for all house and apartment deals made.

>Question: When it comes to analysing the properties can the store manager see all the properties in the system?

>Answer: The goal of this US is to compare property (only house and apartment properties) sale values with the forecast values. Therefore, the system should only show all house and apartments deals made, including deals that were imported from the leagacy system.





### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* AC1. The goal of this US is to forecast property sale prices (only for houses and
apartments) using information from the property area (in square feet), the
distance from the center (in miles), the number of bedrooms, the number of
bathrooms and the number of parking spaces features of each property. In this
study, simple linear and a multi-linear regression models should be developed to
find the linear relationship between: 1- each independent variable and the
dependent variable; 2- all independent variables and the dependent variable. As
the application is under development it is not possible to generate all data
required for the analysis. Therefore, and to simulate a production system, we
made available in moodle a CSV file (generated by the legacy system) containing
information required for this study. The regression analysis should be
documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be
delivered with the application. The report should include property values/prices
(sale prices and forecast prices), the regression model used to estimate each
value, R(SLR), R2 and R2 adjusted for SLR and MLR, confidence intervals and
hypothesis tests for regression coefficients and significance model with Anova

* AC2. All houses and apartments business registered in the system should be used
to fit the regression models.

* AC3. The system should enable the actor to select each regression model and
should present the price estimates using the selected model. Moreover, the
system should show the selected regression model and all required statistics.

* AC4. To implement this US the org.apache.commons.math4.stat package
(https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/stat.html)
should be used.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There must be sold properties in order for us to view the regression graph and the requested data. 
* Dependency on the library org.apache.commons.math4.stat for performing regression analyses.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* CSV file with property information: property area (in square feet), distance from downtown (in miles), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and number of parking spaces.

**Selected Data:**
    

**Output Data:**

* Property sales prices estimated by the regression model.
* Regression model statistics: R (for SLR), R2 and adjusted R2 (for SLR and MLR), confidence intervals, hypothesis tests for regression coefficients, and model significance with Anova.

### 1.7 Functional Requirements

* RF1. The system should allow the store manager to select a regression model (simple linear or multilinear) to analyze real estate deals.
* RF2. The system should allow the store manager to select an independent variable (area of the property, distance from downtown, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, or number of parking spaces) for model fitting.
* RF3. The system should use the data from all the houses and apartments sold in the system to fit the regression models.
* RF4. The system should calculate the sales price estimates for the properties using the selected regression model.
* RF5. The system should present the store manager with the price estimates, the selected regression model, and all necessary statistics.
* RF6. The system should document the regression analysis, including the values of R(SLR), R2 and adjusted R2 for SLR and MLR, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests for regression coefficients, and the significance of the model with Anova, in the application's user manual.

### 1.8 Non-Functional Requirements
* RNF1. The system must use the org.apache.commons.math4.stat package for the implementation of regression analysis (Compliance).
* RNF2. The user interface for the selection of the regression model and the independent variable must be intuitive and easy to use (Usability).
* RNF3. The system should process the regression model and present the price estimates and statistics in an acceptable time, so as not to make the store manager wait too long (Performance).
* RNF4. The system must ensure that the real estate sales data is kept secure and protected from unauthorized access (Security).
* RNF5. Regression analysis and property sales price estimates must be accurate and reliable to support the store manager's business decisions (Reliability).
