# US 018 - Analyse the deals made, based on the characteristics of the property using simple liner regression and multilinear regression

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a store manager, I intend to analyse the deals (only sale of houses and
apartments) made. In particular, I intend to compare property sale values with the
forecast values. The prediction of the value of the business/property must be
estimated based on the characteristics of the property and using linear and
multilinear regression algorithms.

**From the client clarifications:**

>Question: A report containing regression methods, confidence intervals, and other US-related aspects of MATCP is mentioned in the Sprint D requirements document for US018. The team is wondering if this "report" refers to information that should be displayed in the application itself, the user manual, or both. And if the "report" isn't going to be displayed in the app, are we only going to show the user the forecasted price in relation to the chosen property and the regression model with all the necessary statistics?

>Answer: In US18 the application should show, to the store manager, the forecasts, the regression model, statistics, etc.. The teams should use this output of the application to write the report (annexes of the user manual).

>Question: When the store manager selects simple-linear regression to analyse the deals, does he also select one of the specified relevant parameters to serve as the [in]dependent variable in the regression model? ("property area in square feet, the distance from the center, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathroomsand the number of parking spaces").

>Answer: The store manager should choose the independent variable and the regression model to be used to fit the data.

>Question: When the store manager analyses the property values, can he analyse one property, all the properties, or a selection of properties of their choosing?

>Answer: The system should present the price estimates (using the selected regression model) for all house and apartment deals made.

>Question: When it comes to analysing the properties can the store manager see all the properties in the system?

>Answer: The goal of this US is to compare property (only house and apartment properties) sale values with the forecast values. Therefore, the system should only show all house and apartments deals made, including deals that were imported from the leagacy system.





### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* AC1. The goal of this US is to forecast property sale prices (only for houses and
apartments) using information from the property area (in square feet), the
distance from the center (in miles), the number of bedrooms, the number of
bathrooms and the number of parking spaces features of each property. In this
study, simple linear and a multi-linear regression models should be developed to
find the linear relationship between: 1- each independent variable and the
dependent variable; 2- all independent variables and the dependent variable. As
the application is under development it is not possible to generate all data
required for the analysis. Therefore, and to simulate a production system, we
made available in moodle a CSV file (generated by the legacy system) containing
information required for this study. The regression analysis should be
documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be
delivered with the application. The report should include property values/prices
(sale prices and forecast prices), the regression model used to estimate each
value, R(SLR), R2 and R2 adjusted for SLR and MLR, confidence intervals and
hypothesis tests for regression coefficients and significance model with Anova

* AC2. All houses and apartments business registered in the system should be used
to fit the regression models.

* AC3. The system should enable the actor to select each regression model and
should present the price estimates using the selected model. Moreover, the
system should show the selected regression model and all required statistics.

* AC4. To implement this US the org.apache.commons.math4.stat package
(https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/stat.html)
should be used.
